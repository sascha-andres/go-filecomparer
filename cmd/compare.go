// compareCmd represents the compare command
var compareCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "compare",
	Short: "Compare files to file database",
	Long: `Scans the directory and compares to data in file database.

For each change a line will be printed:

D file - file was deleted
A file - file was added
C file - file was changed`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		// TODO: Work your own magic here
		fmt.Println("compare called")
	},
}

func init() {
	RootCmd.AddCommand(compareCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// compareCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// compareCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")

}
